Steps to prepare Kaju Katli:
Step 1 Grind cashews to a fine powder
To make this traditional sweet dish at home, you need to begin with preparing the cashew nut powder. Take 1 1/2 cup cashew nuts and grind them, make sure you don't grind them too much as the cashews might release the oil, which can make the powder coarse. Then using a sieve, extract the fine powder and keep it aside.

Step 2 Prepare the sugar & cashew powder mixture
In the meantime, heat a pan over medium flame and add water along with sugar. Keep stirring till the sugar starts dissolving. Once the blend starts boiling, reduce the flame and add the fine cashew nut powder. Keep stirring and make sure the blend is smooth and has a slightly thick consistency. If you are fond of ghee, add some ghee to this mixture, this will add a nice taste and aroma to this dish. Keep stirring and add cardamom powder. Once this mixture is thick enough, turn off the flame and keep it aside.

Step 3 Knead the Kaju dough & apply the silver varq
Transfer the Kaju katli mixture to a bowl and knead it into a fine smooth dough. Make sure that the Kaju katli dough is smooth and crack-free. Take a tray and grease it with ghee. Then transfer the sweet dough and flatten it using a rolling pin. Apply the silver varq and let it set for some time.
